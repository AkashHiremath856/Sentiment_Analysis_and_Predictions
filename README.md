# NLP Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and extract insights from a diverse range of textual data. The goal is to uncover patterns, sentiment, and meaningful information from text sources, enabling informed decision-making and deeper understanding of the underlying data.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare raw text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the text using machine learning models or lexicon-based approaches.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Visualizes word frequency using word clouds, offering an intuitive representation of prominent terms in the dataset.
- **Text Classification**: Classifies documents into predefined categories or labels using techniques like Naive bayes, KNN.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilizes tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for creating insightful graphs, charts, and visual representations of the analyzed data.
- **Data Insights and Reporting**: Provides detailed reports summarizing the findings and insights obtained from the NLP analysis.
